Think spinach.
Same family as mustard greens and brussel sprouts (*brassica*).

## Store and prep

Be sure to rinse thoroughly before prep because they can hold a lot of dirt.
Buds are apparently edible but I can't find anywhere that says how to cook them.
Wrap the leaves (4) in a damp paper towel, and store them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days.
