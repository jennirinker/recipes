## Eating ideas

...add it to stuff.

## Store and prep

Store fresh chives in the refrigerator in a resealable plastic bag, keeping the air inside, for up to a week.
You can also place the stems standing up in a glass or jar filled with a few inches of water and covered with a plastic bag.
Do not wash until ready to use the chives, as excessive moisture will promote decay.
If your chives are wilted, you can soak in a bowl of ice water to rehydrate before using.
Can be chopped and frozen if needed.
