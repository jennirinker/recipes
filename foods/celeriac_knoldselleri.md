# Celeriac/Celery Root (Knoldselleri)

![knoldselleri](https://saeson-web.dk/media/1074/knoldselleri_4.jpg)

Variety of cellery that has edible root.
Fall vegetable, best from September to April.
Celeriac is a nutritional powerhouse, packed with fiber and vitamins B6, C and K.
It’s also a good source of antioxidants and important minerals, such as phosphorus, potassium and manganese.
Can replace less-healthy root vegetables (e.g., potatoes).

## Eating ideas

* Eat it raw - in salads, coleslaw or French celeriac remoulade.
* Simple pan-fried
  * Dice it and fry it with salt, pepper and a tiny bit of red wine until it's tender (~15 mins)

  * Slice onion, dice celeriac
  * Sauté onion until tender, then add celeriac, some water and thyme
  * Cook with lid on for 10 minutes
  * Chop walnuts
  * Take lid off and boil off the liquid
  * Mash the celeriac and add in crushed walnuts and salt/pepper to taste
  * Put in a dish and bake at 200 C for 25 minutes

## Store and prep

Prepare it by removing the outside:  
* Slice top and bottom off to create flat surfaces.  
* Go around the veggie, slicing off the skin.  
* Rinse the dirt off, then chop.

Storing: Celeriac will last several weeks in the hydrator drawer of the fridge or in a plastic bag in the fridge.
Do not wash before storing in fridge.
Freezing: Celeriac freezes well. Wash, peel and cut into discs or cubes.

* A fair portion of celeriac's aroma molecules possess a mint-like scent, providing links to: blackberries, grapefruit, guava, kiwi, beets, basil, dill, mint, fennel, sage and rosemary
* Orange-scented notes, which share links with apples, bananas, blueberries, cherries, avocado, mascarpone, caraway seeds, brioche, bacon, chicken and grey mullet
* Floral-rose aroma pairs well with apples, pears, raspberries, melon, watermelon, butternut squash, quinoa, kamut, beer, rum, skate wings and elderflower.
* Honey-scented end of the aromatic spectrum, we find links to fava beans, perilla leaves, almond thins, peanut butter, tahini, Parmigiano-Reggiano, blue cheese, Korean doenjang, black garlic and duck
* Popcorn-scented notes that allow us to pair celeriac with cashew nuts, brown rice, freekeh, Camembert, quail, wild boar, shrimp and cuttlefish.
* Cooking celeriac brings out its vanilla and roasted notes. Try serving it with coconut, cake, asparagus, Bayonne ham, crawfish, soy sauce and douchi or Chinese fermented black beans, and you'll see just what we mean.
