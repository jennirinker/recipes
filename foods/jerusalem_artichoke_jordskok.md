# Jerusalem Artichoke (Jordskok)

![jordskok](https://fruitjuice.dk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/jordskok-jerusalem-artichoke-768x768.jpg)

Despite its name, has nothing to do with Jerusalem or artichokes.
It's actually a tuber from a sunflower.
Cook in a similar way to potatoes or parsnips.

High in iron and potassium, theyâ€™re a very healthy vegetable and good for diabetics due to their low glycemic
index and low starch levels, making them a lower calorie alternative to potato. The only downside is the high
levels of inulin Jerusalem artichokes contain, which the body's digestive enzymes cannot break down. This job
gets left to bacteria in the gut, turning it into CO2. This can result in excess gas in some people; a little
embarrassing at a dinner party!


## Eating ideas

* [Stir-fried](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/saut-ed-jerusalem-artichokes-with-garlic-and-bay-leaves/)  
    * Peel and cut into slices
    * Fry in pan over medium heat with bay leaves, garlic, white wind vinager, salt pepper with lid.
    * After 20-25 minutes, remove lid and crisp them a bit before serving.
    * Go well with both meat and fish and are particularly good in a plate of antipasti, or in soups or warm salads.
* [Oven roasted with garlic and rosemary](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/crispy-jerusalem-artichokes-roasted-garlic-rosemary)
    * Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. 
    * Soak the artichokes in cold water for 20 mins or so to loosen any dirt, then scrub them with a scourer, being sure to remove
      any grit
    * Halve the small ones and quarter the bigger ones, and put them in a roasting tin with the split garlic bulb and rosemary.
    * Coat everything with the oil and season. Roast for 45-50 mins until tender inside and crispy outside.
    * Squeeze the softened garlic cloves from their skins and toss with the roasted artichokes, along with the mace, butter and lemon juice

* Eaten raw, like water chestnuts

## Store and prep

The artichoke flesh will discolour if exposed to air, so place the peeled vegetable in a bowl of acidulated water 
(cold water with a sqeeze of lemon juice or a dash of white wine vinegar) until ready to cook.
Because they are so knobbly, it's easier to peel artichokes after boiling.
If stored in a cool, dark place, they will keep well for up to 10 days.


## Pairings

Jerusalem artichokes are best friends with herbs and spices: rosemary, bay, parsley and pepper, cardamom and nutmeg
are the best flavours to add to soups, salads and risottos.
They also go hand in hand with citrus, especially the peel; try grating some onto baked Jerusalem artichokes.

Jerusalem artichokes pair well with red meats such as beef and lamb, but also stand up to much stronger game
birds such as grouse and woodcock.
