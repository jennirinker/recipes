# Stovetop rice

Makes: a lot of rice. (8 servings?)

- 2 cups rice
- 3 cups water
- 2 small spoons salt

1. Rinse rice twice in pot.
2. Add water to pot and cover with lid.
3. Cook 4 minutes on 6 on back burner.
4. Reduce to  1. Simmer for 21 minutes,
   then remove from heat.

Current status: transition from boiling to
simmering still needs convergence.
