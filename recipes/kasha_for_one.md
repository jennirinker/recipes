# Kasha for one.

Kasha = porridge in Russian.

Vegan. Serves 1. Obviously.

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup grains (mid line plastic cup)
- 1 cup water (2x mid line plastic cup)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar


### Cook

1. Put things in a pot on 6.
1. Once boiling, reduce to 2 and stir vigorously until the consistency
looks ok.

## Current status

Had 1 tsp sugar before, was way too much.
Serving size is now okay, maybe a bit large but not too bad.
Jenni, it doesn't look like much but it is enough.
Trust me and stop wanting to make more.
