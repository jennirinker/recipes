## Current status

This is a much better version than the previous attempt. The water needs measuring,
and I need to confirm the serving size. Not sure if it needs more salt, and the red
pepper flakes and garlic are theoretical new additions that need testing. But overall,
this recipe is in an okay place. Would make for friends.
