# Vegan rosinboller (raisin buns).

Vegan. Makes 12. Based on recipe recommended by Emma for fastelavnsboller: [original here](https://miasommer.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/fastelavnsboller/).


### Ingredients

- 600g flour  
- 3 dl lukewarm water  
- 50g feash yeast* (1 package)  
- 100g plant margarine  
- 50g sugar  
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar**  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 50g (?) rasins  
- 1tsp (?) cinnamon  

\* Fresh yeast is a thing in Denmark.
The conversion for 50g fresh yeast is approximately 25g active dry yeast or approximately 12g instant yeast.  
** Vanilla sugar is also a thing in Denmark instead of vanilla extract. 1 tsp vanilla sugar is about 2/3 tsp vanilla extract.

### Make and bake

1. Place the water, yeast, sugar, vanilla sugar, and salt together in a big bowl.
   Squish the yeast block with your fingers until it is fully dissolved in the mixture.  
1. Melt the margarine, then add it to the liquid mixture.  
1. Mix the flour and cinnamon together in a different bowl.  
1. Slowly add in the dry ingredients to the liquid mixture, blending it with your hands until all of it is taken up.
   Cover the bowl and let it rise 35 minutes.  
1. Empty the dough on a lightly floured surface and "knock it back" while adding in the raisins.
   Separate the dough into 12 equal pieces and place them on a baking tray.
   Let them rise 30 minutes, but set an alarm to remind yourself to warm the oven.  
1. When 10 minutes are left, set the oven to the warm-air setting at 190 C.
1. Bake about 10 minutes or until golden brown.

## Current status

Amount of raisins is unmeasured. Consider melting margarine and painting the tops of them.
Baked too long/hot last time, so next time try 190 for oven.
I forgot the cinnamon last time.
